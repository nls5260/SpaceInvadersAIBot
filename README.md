# Tetris AI Bot

The goal of the project as to make a AI bot that played Tetris. We used Emu Hawk as an emulator to play the game. For this project we drew inspiration from the "MarI/O - Machine Learning for Video Games" video by youtuber SethBling. We used this code as a starting point to figure out how to program our Tetris AI bot.
